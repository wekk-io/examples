In order to manage the databases and roles of a CockroachDB cluster with the [External PostgreSQL operator](https://github.com/movetokube/postgres-operator), the trick is to install the resources with [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) and patch the External PostgreSQL operator `Deployment` to make it use the secret generated by the CockroachDB operator. At CockroachDB only setups TLS authentication by default, we have to mount the TLS CA, certificate and key in the External PostgreSQL operator `Deployment` and setup PostgreSQL connection string parameters to use these files.
